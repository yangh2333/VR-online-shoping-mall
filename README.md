# VR-online-shoping-mall
Why big companies did not creat a kind of totally VR shoping system?Is the cost too much? Or the technology is not ready？Or just because nobody in the big Online retailers ever reached this idea？

After a little time on google， I learned that Buy+ of Taobao is one of the VR shoping platforms.So I watched some information about it.I get one point of this product：move the shops in the real world to the VR glasses.This maybe a good business model for online be united with offline Consumption scenario.But in my opinion I would like to set the concept of VR-online-shoping-mall as a totally virtual world where all of us are living here.

It must have these Features：
1.A 3D digital world with magnificent and beautiful scene.
2.Multikinds of shop decoration styles for companies or personal sellers.
3.Permanent property right of digital shops.
4.Open and transparent commodity information and trading rules.
5.Mapping internet IP and 3D world address for every  participants.
6.Front interface for users across all kinds of hardwares，like PC ，phone，Pad，VR glasse or Holographic projection devices.
7.Goods are not the only one which can be seen，but also all kinds of services.Fun and happy is the ending purpose.Creativity can be merged by this platform.Any one participated in it can spend their talent.But doing business based on social position or blood connection with family members.Evil secrets in this world can be digested.
